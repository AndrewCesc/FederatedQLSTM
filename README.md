# FederatedQLSTM

This is the source code for the quantum federated learning (QFL) framework that utilizes quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) models, which called the (FedQLSTM) framework, and is proposed in our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14309

Please make sure to properly cite the paper if you used any part of this code.
